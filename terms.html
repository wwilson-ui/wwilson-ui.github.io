    <h2>1. Educational Use & Eligibility</h2>
    <p>The Civics Brief Generator is an educational tool designed to assist middle school and high school students in learning the mechanics of legal writing and the functions of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
    <p class="highlight">There are no age restrictions to use this service.</p> 
    <p>This service is intended for classroom use and is designed to be accessible to students of all ages without restriction.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Privacy & Collection</h2>
    <p>We take student privacy seriously. This service follows a "privacy-by-design" approach:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or sell any personal information or the content of the briefs created on this site.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All document data is stored locally in your web browser or saved as a file on your personal device (exported as a .civics file).</li>
        <li><strong>Google Authentication:</strong> If you choose to "Sign in with Google," we only use your authentication to provide a personalized save experience. We do not access your contacts, emails, or other private data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Educational Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>This tool is a formatting engine intended for <strong>educational simulations only</strong>. It does not provide legal advice, and the documents produced are for classroom moot court projects. The use of the "U.S. Supreme Court" style does not imply any official legal standing or affiliation with the Judiciary.</p>

    <h2>4. Accuracy of Work</h2>
    <p>Users are responsible for the legal accuracy and integrity of their own citations and arguments. The generator is responsible only for the mechanical formatting of the text provided by the student.</p>
